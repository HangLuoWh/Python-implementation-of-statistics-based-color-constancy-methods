# Python-implementation-of-statistics-based-color-constancy-methods
I use Python to implement some classical statistic-based color constancy methods, like: gray world, white patch, gray edge, PCA-based (Cheng's method), gray pixels (by Yang and Qian) and so on. The motivation of this work lies in that the official implementations of these classical methods are based on Matlab and some people may be not familiar with Matlab. Thus, we use python, a widely used programming language, to reimplement these methods to reduce the costs to master these methods.
